# Gridfinity parts

These are custom bases and parts for [Gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8) that are useful to me.  Feel free to use these as you see fit.

### Bases

- [Junk drawer]() Base for a XxX drawer that can be printed in 6 parts on a Prusa Mk3

### Parts

- [BQ-CC17](./parts/battery-charger) Holder for a Panasonic [BQ-CC17](https://www.panasonic.com/global/energy/products/eneloop/en/lineup/charger-bq-cc17.html) battery charger.
- [Clear Tape](./parts/clear-tape) Holder for the small size roll of Scotch tape, labeled as "Gift Wrap Tape".
- [Husky Precision Screwdriver](./parts/husky-precision-screwdriver) Holder for a [Husky Precision Screwdriver](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Husky-Ratcheting-Precision-Screwdriver-Set-23-Piece-H23PCSDSET/300117121) set, including the driver and all 22 bits.

## Printing

There is a makefile in each base or part that will generate one or more *.3mf files in a `build` folder.  This requires the OpenSCAD CLI to be installed, and I am using 2024-01-14.
