# Gridfinity parts

These are custom bases and parts that are useful to me.  Feel free to use these as you see fit.

### Bases

- [Junk drawer]() Base for a XxX drawer that can be printed in 6 parts on a Prusa Mk3

### Parts

- [BQ-CC17](./parts/battery-charger) Holder for a Panasonic [BQ-CC17](https://www.panasonic.com/global/energy/products/eneloop/en/lineup/charger-bq-cc17.html) battery charger.

## Printing

There is a makefile in each base or part that will generate one or more *.3mf files in a `build` folder.  This requires the OpenSCAD CLI to be installed, and I am using 2024-01-14.
